**--Schedule Me--**  

**Summary**    
Schedule Me is a simple web app to help groups coordinate meeting times.  
Users can create or join an event, enter their availability, and view the top times when most people are available  

This was built as part of an independent study with my mentor, Shane Donahue.  
The goal was to learn new things, not focus on design. I mainly wanted to practice working with databases, React, and real-time updates in a real project.  

**Features**  
	•	Create a new event by entering an event name and your name  
	•	Join an existing event with a provided sharable link  
	•	Submit your available times  
	•	View the most popular meeting times based on everyone’s availability  
	•	Real time database updates using Firebase  
	•	Sharable event links for easy group access
